         <h1> Benji Savings App </h1>
         <span> About </span>
         <p>  Benji is a money saving app with a focus on meeting financial goals. With the app users are able to budget, save, and track expenses all in the same place.
            Benji aims to make saving for large purchases more accessible to those who are unfamiliar with the world of finance and can be used to save for any goal.
         </p>
         <span> Problem Statement </span>
         <p> Benji users are familiar with technology but are no experts in finance. So, it is important that the tool be effective, inviting, and simple to use. Data on income and expenses is clearly organized and easily recorded from a variety of devices. </p>
         <span> User Stories </span>
         <p> A user flow diagram was developed based on the three user stories below. </p>
         <p> 1. As a user, I want to see a dashboard of my finances clearly and visually, so that I can see how much I am spending on what at a glance. </p>
         <p> 2. As a user, I need to be able to tell the tool what my savings goal is and how long I have to reach it, so that I can save accordingly. </p>
         <p> 3. As a user, I want to receive a personalized savings plan, so that I can save enough money to reach my goal in time. </p>
         <span> User Flows </span>
         <p> After gathering information on my potential users I started organization the structure and flow of my product. </p>

         <span> Low and Mid-Fidelity Wireframes </span>
         <p> After honing in on my users and their goals I began creating wireframes. I designed low-fidelity screens to allow me to create many different mockups quickly before landing on my initial layouts and then translated them into the first iteration of mid-fidelity wireframes. </p>

         <span> Low and Mid-Fidelity Wireframes </span>
         <p>
            After much research, testing, and many iterations I landed on my final design.

            <span> Typography </span>
            <p>
               I chose two fonts for my portfolio. The first is Playfair Display SC for titles and headers. I wanted something eye-catching and strong. The second font I chose is SF Pro. I wanted something a bit softer to complement the bold look of Playfair Display SC and liked the way they worked together.
            </p>
            <span> Color </span>
            <p> I have always been very drawn to colors found in nature because I think they are naturally perfectly complimentary. I found this image of a field of wild flowers when I was searching for inspiration. The blue color felt appropriate since itâ€™s one of my favorite colors to wear and I thought it would pop nicely. I loved the warm mix of oranges and yellows and adjusted to create a palette that I felt was visually appealing and reflective of my personality. </p>
